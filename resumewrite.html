            <h3>step 2</h3>
            <h4>Pick the best resume format for your needs</h4>
            <p>
              Now that you’ve prepared your information, here’s a secret on how
              to create a resume that many job seekers overlook: You have to
              choose a suitable resume format before you can begin to write a
              resume.
            </p>
            <p>
              How to choose the best resume format? There are three standard
              formats. Each uses the same resume sections but organizes them
              differently, so choose one that works best for your work
              experience level and your professional goals.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Chronological resume format</h5>
            <img src="assets/img/resum5.png" alt="" />
            <h5>Functional resume format</h5>
            <img src="assets/img/resum6.png" alt="" />
            <h5>Combination resume format</h5>
            <img src="assets/img/resum8.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>step 3</h3>
            <h4>Add your contact information.</h4>
            <p>
              Make sure your contact information is up-to-date and easy to find.
              Always put it at the top, in the header.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="points">
            <p>Here’s what to include in your resume contact information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Full name</li>
              <li>Phone number</li>
              <li>Professional email address</li>
              <li>City and ZIP code</li>
              <li>
                A link to your professional social media account, website or
                portfolio if you have them.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="points">
            <h3>step 4</h3>
            <h4>Make a resume work history section</h4>
            <p>
              Format this resume section by listing jobs in
              reverse-chronological order, with the current or latest position
              at the top and display. Here’s how to create a resume work
              experience section. You’ll need:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your title</li>
              <li>Company name</li>
              <li>Company location (city and state)</li>
              <li>Dates of employment (month and year)</li>
              <li>
                Three-to-five bullet points with your top work achievements and
                duties
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>for example:</p>
            <img src="assets/img/resum9.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>step 5</h3>
            <h4>Create a resume skills section to highlight your strengths.</h4>
            <p>
              When thinking about what to put on a resume skills section, aim
              for an average of six to eight of your top strengths, as long as
              they are relevant to the job you want. If you are changing careers
              or applying for your first job,, focus on transferable skills like
              communication and critical thinking, which can apply to almost any
              job.
